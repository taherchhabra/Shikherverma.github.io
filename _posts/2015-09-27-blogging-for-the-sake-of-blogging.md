I started my blog in 2011 and wrote couple of posts about software development. My Last blog post was in 2013 and today is 2015. I didn't blog for last two years. I kept procrastinating and kept feeling guilty. I wanted to blog each time I saw a new technology, new plugin, new framework, new thing which I worked on, on political situation in my country, on corruption, on poverty, on illiteracy and so many other things . But I didn't do it.

If I make a list of reasons why I didn't blogged they will be something like
1. Didn't had time.
2. Didn't had things to Post
3. No readers on my blog
4. I am an introvert and don't like to share much
5. What will people think if I write something which they don't like or don't agree with.
6. Blah Blah Blah.

But somewhere I know that the above reasons were not the ones stopping me from blogging. The real reason which was stopping me is "Blogging for the sake of Blogging.".
I had created this blog not to share my ideas/opinions with the world, but to impress my future employers / to get freelancing clients.
This was part of my resume gardening, Part of my showing to the world that I 'know this stuff'. I had this blog just for the sake of having a blog and not out of love or interest.

There is nothing wrong if you have a blog for the purpose stated above, but I am a kind of person who does something only if I like doing that. If I do something out of compulsion, I am usually Bad at it.

So from today, I have decided that I will blog not out of compulsion but out of love.
This will not just be a tech blog in a race to post about "new" features of the "new" framework. It will be random blog with random posts. Whatever comes to my mind which I feel worthy enough to share will be shared here. It will be a reflection of my thoughts / Opinions / Life.

Who knows when will be my next post, maybe tomorrow or maybe after a year. but whenever I post next, It will not be to impress someone, It will be for myself
